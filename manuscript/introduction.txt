# Introduction

I'm lazy. Let's face it, we never want to re-write the same old thing which is why we developed sophisticated tools to help us and [Jinja2]() is one of those tools. The idea of this mini-ebook is to profile a list of examples that you can use to help yourself out.

This is some default content for a new Leanpub book.
